# Sam Mulcahy Prework Study Guide Project

## Description

This project was created so that I would be able to enter into the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp with the base knowledge necessary to set me up for success. In creating this webpage I have encouraged a growth mindset and begun to think as a developer.

## Installation

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To utilize this study guide you may observe what is on screen. The text shares many useful tips in regards to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Additionally you could enter the Chrome Development Tool by clicking "Inspect Element" after right clicking on the page. Within the development tool you are able to observe both the code responsible for the web page, but also a backend section dedicated to JavaScript. The Javascript will randomly pick from the four subjects displayed on the page to assign one for you to study.
